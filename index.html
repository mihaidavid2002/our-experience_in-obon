        <p>Welcome to our page dedicated to our Erasmus experience in the beautiful Spanish village of<br>
          Obon! During our stay in this idyllic place, we had the privilege to explore not only the<br>
           wonderful landscapes of the regions, but also the deep concepts of ecology and gender equality.<br>
            With each sunrise and each conversation with our organizers, we discovered new perspectives and<br>
             learned valuable lessons about our relationship with the environment and the importance of<br>
              promoting gender equality. In this page, we will share our experiences, thoughts and <br>
              reflections.</p>
          <p>Our experience started at Marisica, the place where we stayed. It was a place full of charm<br>
            and peace. The hosts welcomed us with open arms, turning every moment into an experience full<br>
             of hospitality</p>

        <h2>Ecology and Gender Equality</h2>

        <p>Participating in the Erasmus project in Spain on greening and<br>
          gender equality was a profound and transformative experience for<br>
           us. This opportunity to collaborate with people from different<br>
            countries and explore complex topics related to the environment<br>
             and gender opened new perspectives and provided valuable lessons.<br>
             First, gender equality does not mean that all people must be <br>
             treated exactly the same, but that they must be given equal<br>
              opportunities and allowed to realize their potential equally.<br>
            To promote gender equality, it is important to recognize and<br>
             combat gender stereotypes that can affect how people are <br>
             perceived and treated in society. For example, preconceived <br>
             ideas about what it means to be "man" or "woman" can limit <br>
             individual choices and opportunities.<br>
        The experience in Spain also highlighted to us the importance of <br>
        international collaboration in solving global problems. By interacting<br>
         with participation from different countries, we learned to appreciate<br>
          the diversity of approaches and solutions in the field of ecology and <br>
          gender equality, and realized that the exchange of good practices <br>
          and knowledge can accelerate progress in these areas.</p>

        <p> We also understood that education and awareness play a crucial <br>
         role in promoting green behaviors and gender equality in society. <br>
         Through awareness-raising activities and the exchange of experience<br>
          between participants from various cultural backgrounds, we <br>
          realized that each individual can contribute to protecting the <br>
          environment and combating gender inequalities through personal <br>
          and community-level actions.</p>
